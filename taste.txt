Douglas finished the last of the cherries he picked up and made his way through the open fields. He didn't expect to collide into anyone, after all his people were a dying breed. How did they die? Through poison mostly, through burns some. Survivors burns are the worst, because their tongues are broken. They can not taste anymore. What is life when you can no longer perceive?
And soon even the survivors kill themselves.

But today, as he made his way across the field he collided with another moving figure. It grabbed his arm and ran its tongue up his cheek, he did the same. The creature was human, he caught their mouth with his. This person tasted of lemon, 'Maya' he recognized. Maya was a girl he grew up with. In fact everyone was someone he grew up with, his generation was the only one.

They parted, Maya spit on the ground. She didn't like the way he tasted, too sweet. She didn't like cherries neither; they stung.
