Rai closed her eyes, for a brief moment the world disappears. No input, nothing, pure blackness. The buzz of the city gone, no cars jammed in the "highway" below her. She opens them again and notice a small green light at the left corner of her glasses. Oh, a message. She taps the side of her frames twice, to indicate she wants to read the message.

It was from her husband, Guntur: Honey, just a reminder, I will be exhibiting at the Hino Gallery tonight. I know lab work is unpredictable and often keeps you late. But I would appreciate if you do come and show your support.

Well if Rai is to make it to the gallery opening tonight, she should get back to work. She continues down the sky bridge, bypassing projected advertisements on building walls for products and films.
~ how do I describe silent films? what is the one coming out that Rai wanted to see?
